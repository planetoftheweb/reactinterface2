Hey there, this is Ray Villalobos and thanks for watching this course.

We have a ton of other React content on the library, so if you want to learn more about it, make sure you do a search on our site.

As I mentioned this course is part of a series of related courses where I build a similar application using different frameworks. It can give you a real good idea of what the differences between Vue, React, Angular and even jquery. The best way to find those is to just do a search for by ray villalobos interface
